MQTT examples between Olimex ESP32-POE and Olimex ESP32-POE-ISO and public broker mqttx 

Each folder contains example with own ino file suitable for Arduino IDE. The four examples are:

ESP32-PoE_MQTT_GPIO - scans for the button state with commands via the MQTT app; uses WIFI for connecting to the internet;

ESP32-PoE_MQTT_GPIO_ETH - scans for the button state with commands via the MQTT app; uses Ethernet for connecting to the internet;

ESP32-PoE_MQTT_I2C - uses MOD-RTC module that is connected to the UEXT and I2C, allows to print data from MOD-RTC via the MQTT app using commands (time and date); uses WIFI for connecting;

ESP32-PoE_MQTT_I2C_ETH - uses MOD-RTC module that is connected to the UEXT and I2C, allows to print data from MOD-RTC via the MQTT app using commands (time and date); uses Ethernet for the Internet connection.

- Setting the ESP32-PoE with the code:

1. Pick one of the three Arduino examples. "ESP32-PoE_MQTT_GPIO" is easier to use since it requires no extra hardware. Demo  allows to scan the button state.
2. Edit the WIFI settings inside the example with the one of your WIFI network. Refer to the comments in the code. 
3. Make sure to install the library Sketch --> Include Library --> Manage Libraries... --> search for PubSubClient by Nick O'Leary
4. Build the example and download it to the ESP32-POE or ESP32-POE-ISO via Arduino IDE (remember to install the ESP32 for Arduino package, selected ESP32-POE or ESP32-POE-ISO from the board selector).

- Setting the MQTT application:

1. Download the app from: https://mqttx.app/ and install it
2. Start the application
3. Create a "New Connection"
4. Enter a name and Client ID (they can be whatever)
5. Leave Host and Port with their default values: (mqtt://broker.emqx.io:1883)
6. Connect
7. Create a "New Subscription"
  7.1. At the Topic field you must enter the same topic that is defined in the Arduino sketch (for example: emqx/ESP32-POE_GPIO). This is the topic you will listen to.
  7.2  At the bottom of the screen (just above the text box with the message) you type the same topic. This is the topic you will send to.
8. Click connect and you are ready to send and receive data.

Note: If you need, you can have multiple topics, from which you receive messages within the same connection.

Check the comments in the code for better understanding.
